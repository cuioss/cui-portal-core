/**
 * Provides project stage management for Portal applications.
 *
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 * This package contains components for managing and determining the current
 * project stage (Development, Production, etc.) of a Portal application.
 * It enables stage-specific behavior and configuration across the application.
 *
 * <h2>Key Components</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link de.cuioss.portal.common.stage.ProjectStage} - Enumeration defining
 *       available project stages and providing stage detection logic</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Examples</h2>
 * <pre>
 *
 * // Check for specific stage
 * if (stage.isDevelopment()) {
 *     // Enable development-specific features
 * }
 *
 * // Configure based on stage
 * switch (stage) {
 *     case DEVELOPMENT:
 *         enableDetailedLogging();
 *         break;
 *     case PRODUCTION:
 *         enableCaching();
 *         break;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * All components in this package are thread-safe. The project stage is determined
 * at application startup and remains constant throughout the application lifecycle.
