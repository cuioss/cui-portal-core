/**
 * Enumerates the specific reasons for connection failures in the portal's connection system.
 * This enum provides a structured way to categorize connection errors without relying on
 * exception type inspection, enabling consistent error handling and user feedback.
 * <p>
 * The error reasons are grouped into several categories:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Authentication failures (credentials, tokens)</li>
 *   <li>Security configuration issues (keystores, truststores)</li>
 *   <li>Connection configuration problems (URLs, types, IDs)</li>
 *   <li>Network and I/O errors</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each error reason includes a human-readable error message that can be used
 * for logging or user interface display.
