= portal-deltaspike

== What's that?

Portal specific port of some, not all deltaspike modules.

Ratio: Decouple from the release model, that is currently lacking the 'punch'.

Regarding quality it is "as it is", derived by version 1.9.6. It does not comply with 
the cui-quality-standards. The idea is, that it can be replaced again by the original

It can not be used in conjunction with other deltspike modules, but it can be replaced by them.

But then you need the whole set!
