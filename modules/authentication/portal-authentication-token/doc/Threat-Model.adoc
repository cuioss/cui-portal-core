Generated by https://codeium.com/windsurf 

== Overview

The Portal Authentication Token module provides functionality for handling JWT tokens in a portal environment, primarily focusing on token parsing, validation, and claim extraction. The module is built on top of SmallRye JWT and is designed to work with OAuth2/OpenID Connect providers, with specific testing against Keycloak.

== System Context

The module operates within the following context:

* Processes JWT tokens from OAuth2/OpenID Connect providers
* Validates token signatures using JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets)
* Extracts and processes token claims
* Handles multiple token types (Access, ID, Refresh)
* Supports multiple issuers

== STRIDE Threat Analysis

=== Spoofing

==== Threats
* S1: Attacker submits forged JWT tokens
* S2: Attacker impersonates legitimate JWKS endpoint
* S3: Attacker reuses expired or revoked tokens

==== Current Mitigations
* Using SmallRye JWT for cryptographic operations
* JWKS endpoint validation
* Token signature verification
* Expiration time validation

==== Recommendations
* Implement token blacklisting for revoked tokens
* Add rate limiting for token validation attempts
* Implement strict issuer validation
* Add additional token metadata validation (e.g., `nbf`, `aud` claims)

=== Tampering

==== Threats
* T1: Modification of token content during transmission
* T2: Tampering with cached JWKS data
* T3: Manipulation of token parsing process

==== Current Mitigations
* Signature verification using public keys
* Size limits on tokens and payloads
* Immutable token objects
* Type-safe claim extraction

==== Recommendations
* Implement integrity checks for cached JWKS data
* Add logging for signature verification failures
* Implement strict content-type validation
* Add checksums for cached data

=== Repudiation

==== Threats
* R1: Denial of token usage
* R2: Unauthorized token refresh attempts
* R3: Missing audit trail for token operations

==== Current Mitigations
* Logging of token parsing attempts
* Logging of validation failures
* Token ID tracking

==== Recommendations
* Enhance logging with correlation IDs
* Add structured logging for security events
* Implement token usage tracking
* Add audit logs for sensitive operations

=== Information Disclosure

==== Threats
* I1: Exposure of sensitive claims
* I2: Leakage of token data in logs
* I3: Exposure of JWKS cache contents
* I4: Debug information exposure

==== Current Mitigations
* Limited logging of token content
* Size limits to prevent memory dumps
* Secure error handling
* No sensitive data in toString() methods

==== Recommendations
* Implement claim sanitization in logs
* Add data masking for sensitive claims
* Implement secure key storage for JWKS
* Add security headers for external requests

=== Denial of Service

==== Threats
* D1: JWKS endpoint flooding
* D2: Large token processing
* D3: Complex token structures
* D4: Resource exhaustion through parallel requests

==== Current Mitigations
* Token size limits (8KB)
* Payload size limits (16KB)
* JWKS refresh interval controls
* Null checks and validation

==== Recommendations
* Implement request throttling
* Add circuit breakers for external calls
* Implement resource pools
* Add timeout mechanisms

=== Elevation of Privilege

==== Threats
* E1: Token scope manipulation
* E2: Role/permission injection
* E3: Privilege escalation through claim manipulation
* E4: Bypass of token validation

==== Current Mitigations
* Strict claim type checking
* Signature validation
* Non-nullable constraints
* Type-safe claim extraction

==== Recommendations
* Implement role hierarchy validation
* Add scope validation rules
* Implement strict claim value validation
* Add permission boundary checks

== Critical Security Controls

* Logging best practices
* Exception handling

=== Logging
* Security event logging

== Security Configuration

=== Required Settings
