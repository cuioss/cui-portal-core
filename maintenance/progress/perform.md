# Java Package-Level Maintenance Progress

## Test Refactoring Phase

### portal-common-cdi
Status: In Progress

#### Test Structure Review
- [x] Test naming follows conventions
  - Tests are named with suffix "Test"
  - Class names clearly indicate what is being tested
- [x] Test methods are focused and well-organized
  - Methods have clear, descriptive names
  - Each test focuses on a specific functionality
- [x] Proper use of test fixtures and setup
  - Uses @BeforeEach for test initialization
  - Appropriate use of @Produces for CDI beans
- [x] Clear separation of unit and integration tests
  - Uses Weld testing framework for CDI integration tests
  - Proper scope activation with @ActivateScopes

#### Test Coverage
- [x] Core functionality tests
  - [x] ResourceBundle management
    - Tests bundle loading
    - Tests locale switching
    - Tests key resolution
  - [x] CDI utilities
    - Tests bean resolution
    - Tests scope handling
  - [x] Locale handling
    - Tests locale change events
    - Tests bundle reloading
  - [x] Project stage management
    - Tests development vs production behavior
    - Tests error handling differences
- [x] Edge case testing
  - [x] Extremely long keys
  - [x] Concurrent access
  - [x] Special characters in keys
  - [x] Invalid configurations
  - [x] Error states
- [x] Error handling tests
  - [x] MissingResourceException handling
  - [x] Invalid key handling
  - [x] Null/empty input handling
- [x] Configuration tests
  - [x] Different project stages
  - [x] Various locale configurations
  - [x] Bundle priority handling

#### Test Quality
- [x] Assertions are meaningful and specific
  - Uses explicit assertEquals with clear messages
  - Proper exception testing with assertThrows
  - Clear assertion messages
- [x] Test data is well-defined and maintainable
  - Uses support classes for test data
  - Clear test value organization
  - Parameterized tests for variations
- [x] Mocks and stubs are used appropriately
  - Uses CDI producers for controlled dependencies
  - Clean separation of test doubles
  - Proper test bundle implementations
- [x] Test independence
  - Verified no shared state between tests
  - Each test properly initializes its state
  - Concurrent access tests added

#### Documentation
- [x] Test purpose is clearly documented
  - Added comprehensive class documentation
  - Added method-level documentation
  - Documented test scenarios
- [x] Test scenarios are described
  - Each test method describes its scenarios
  - Edge cases are documented
  - Error conditions are explained
- [x] Setup requirements are documented
  - CDI configuration documented
  - Test bundle setup explained
  - Locale handling described
- [x] Special test configurations explained
  - Documented scope requirements
  - Explained producer configurations
  - Described test bundle hierarchy

#### Next Steps
1. Build and verify the changes
2. Run all tests to ensure no regressions
3. Fix any issues found during verification
