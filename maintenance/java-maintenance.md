# Java Maintenance Progress

## Maintenance Rules
### Test Refactoring Phase
- Production code changes are strictly prohibited without explicit user confirmation
- Any proposed production code changes must be accompanied by detailed reasoning including:
  * Clear problem statement
  * Impact analysis
  * Potential risks
  * Alternative solutions considered
- Only proceed with production code changes after receiving explicit user approval
- Focus areas during test refactoring:
  * Test framework and annotation updates
  * Test organization and readability improvements
  * Test coverage enhancements for existing functionality
  * Test pattern and assertion modernization
  * Test-specific issue resolution

             * Message handling tests
             * Locale handling tests
             * Error handling tests
             * Key handling tests
           - Added comprehensive test coverage:
             * Multiple locale changes
             * Concurrent access to keySet
             * Serialization/deserialization
             * Bundle content retrieval
           - Added parameterized tests for:
             * Different message keys
             * Invalid input handling
           - Added descriptive test names and assertion messages
           - Verified thread safety and concurrent access
       - Code Quality:
         1. Logging improvements
           - Ensured proper log level usage (DEBUG for informational messages, WARN for issues)
           - Added descriptive log messages with class names and context
           - Fixed test assertions to verify correct log messages
   - Next Steps:
     * Continue examining other classes in the module
